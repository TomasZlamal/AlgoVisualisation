# AlgoVisualisation
A project to visualise certain node-exploring algorithms

Currently, I've only implemented BFS and DFS to visit all nodes. In the future, I plan on adding obstacles and BFS and DFS to find a certain node.

The project is created with a OOP/Procedural programming paradigm in mind. The AppState class is meant to be implemented as a Singleton class.
