# AlgoVisualisation
A project to visualise certain node-exploring algorithms built using wxWidgets.

Currently, I've only implemented BFS and DFS to visit all nodes and a certain node. In the future, I plan on adding obstacles.

The project is created with a OOP/Procedural programming paradigm in mind. The AppState class is meant to be implemented as a Singleton class. As this project will likely not be using multithreading, the getInstance method is not thread-safe.
